# Your App:

- You will build a fully functional web app. 
- **Whatever web app you want to build.** 
- You are free to choose what it will do **but** *you can't* build a note taking app nor an address book, i.e.
- It needs to be an app that does not only provide the same functionalities we've seen in the exercises such as adding and searching for text!

# The rating:
## In order to successfully complete the course, your app will need to feature the following points:

- It is available on **GitHub**.
- It uses the **Flask** web framework.
- It uses **at least one module** from the Python Standard Library *other than the random module* (for example, you could use the datetime module.)
- It contains **at least one class** written by you that has both properties and methods (plural!), including *instantiating* the class and *using the methods* in your app. Methods that just print something in the terminal will not be considered.
- It makes use of **JavaScript in the front end** and uses the **localStorage** of the web browser.
- It uses **modern JavaScript** (for example, let and const rather than var).
- It makes use of the **writing to** and **reading from** the same file feature.
- It contains both **conditional statements and loops**.
- It **doesn't generate any error message** even if the user enters a wrong input.
- It lets the **user enter a value in a text box** at some point. This **value should be received and processed** by your back end Python code.
- The code follows the code and style conventions we introduced in the course, is **fully documented** using comments and *doesn't contain unused or experimental code*. In particular, the code should not use print() or console.log() for any information the app user should see. Instead, all user feedback needs to be visible in the browser.
